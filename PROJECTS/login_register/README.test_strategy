                Cannot set cookie() in PHPUNIT.
                Error message:Cannot modify header information - headers already sent by
                setcookie() does not set $_COOKIE[] in phpunit.
                Need to revisit this. Is seems that $_COOKIE doesn't get setup when called from
                PHPUNIT. 
                
DB.php          Need to study indepth about testing DB.  There is a lot of reading in PHPUNIT.

Input.php       done
InputRules.php  Having all kinds of problems.  Getting PDO exception: Cannot find driver.
                Read all documents.  php -m says that I don't have PDO_mysql.
                Tried to install PDO_mysql, but Ubuntu cannot locate  package errors.
                Workaround is to use mockery.  Implement Mockery and see if this works for
                DB testing.
                Things to do:
                1. Read SF.com on PHPunit DB testing
                2. Read PHPunit manual on DB testing.
                3. Post questions to SF, Cloud9.

IReport.php     This is an abstract class.  There is no need to test this.               

MostVisitsReport.php  Deals with DB.
                      This maybe okay with mockery.
                      
Redirect.php        Need to read.  This is not easy as I thought.
                    Source: stackoverflow.com, google search has Laravel.
                    Seems like not an easy subject.
                    Must understand the content of a web page after a redirect.
